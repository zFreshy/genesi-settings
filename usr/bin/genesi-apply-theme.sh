# Genesi OS - Theme Applicator (first-login safety net)
#
# The Genesi desktop config (wallpaper, color scheme, icon theme, window
# decoration) is pre-seeded into the user's HOME from skel-override, so a
# correctly-seeded login already paints Genesi on the FIRST frame:
#   - kwinrc      -> Klassy decoration, blur, rounded corners (read at KWin start)
#   - kdeglobals  -> ColorScheme=Genesi, Icons=Tela-circle-green-dark, Darkly
#   - appletsrc   -> wallpaper = /usr/share/wallpapers/genesi/wallpaper.png
#
# This script is only a guarded fallback for the case where a setting didn't
# take, and it is deliberately FLICKER-FREE. It NEVER restarts kwin or
# plasmashell -- the old `kwin --replace` (compositor black-flash) and
# `plasmashell --replace` (panel rebuild) were exactly the "2 piscadas" we want
# gone. It applies any missing bits live and asks KWin to reload config in place.

# Wait until plasmashell is actually up (no fixed-sleep race).
